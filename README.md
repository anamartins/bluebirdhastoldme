This is my first big project. I'm a Animal Crossing: New Horizons fan, so I've decided that my first project would definitely be ACNH related. I wanted to learn how to work with APIs, so I've decided working with Twitter API and I've made my own, the glorious <a href="https://github.com/anamartins/isablath">Isabelle & Blathers</a>. It was a quite fun experience. Every now and then I do some adjustments, like adding tests or other villager information. I'm totally open for tips and advices. ✨✨
